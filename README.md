# Integrating with DOVU Market ðŸ•Š

In this document you will learn how you can work with DOVU to support the purchase of DOVU's fully auditable credits on behalf of your clients.

> Please note, this is an evolving documentation and may be subject to change, we will always take "best effort" precautions for the communication of the backwards compatibility of systems.

Below, we will describe the basic flow of what you can expect. It will follow with example payloads of data packets that your systems can receive to keep track of your clients purchasing credits through the [DOVU marketplace](https://app.dovu.market/).

## Your interaction with DOVU, a flow.

As fully-auditable credits are a highly limited resource we will work with whitelisted clients on a one-on-one basis to ensure that we can reserve enough credits for qualifying use cases.

    Customer->>DOVU: Purchase of credits from DOVU marketplace
    DOVU->>Customer: On purchase, redirect back to frontend
    DOVU-->>Integrator: Webhook payload of credits purchase
```

## Starting an integration

You should provide these items to DOVU before starting an integration:

1. Company name
2. DOVU Market Webhook Endpoint (we will test this with a "hello world" request)
3. Redirect Endpoint (Redirecting back to a SaaS platform)
4. A square company logo (minimum size 512px x 512px as a JPEG, PNG or SVG)

You will receive these following items when you start integrating with DOVU.

1. Partner identifier
2. HMAC Secret Key

Your partner identifier allows us to notify your application when a purchase is made. You should combine all interactions with the DOVU marketplace with a **ref** to identify a given customer for your incoming webhook.

## Credit Purchase Widget

We provide a simple frontend widget which can be dropped into your site for integration with our platform.

Please see the example setup instructions [here](/examples/carbon-offset-widget/README.md).

## After purchase flow

The partner identifier will be stored within the cookies of a given Consumer, this will provide them access to your reserved credits, when they complete a purchase they can be redirected back to your platform, and a corresponding webhook will be sent to your system.

### Example webhook payload

Below is the example payload with a specification of what your server will receive.

It is ultimately up to you (but highly recommended) whether you wish to include the HMAC verification, using your **HMAC Secret Key** provided earlier to decode the message and verify DOVU is the correct originator.

Please follow our documentation for [Guardian security on how to construct and deal with HMAC](https://github.com/dovuofficial/guardian-middleware-api#security) you can also follow our implementation of [validation of HMAC signatures](https://github.com/dovuofficial/guardian-middleware-api/blob/main/src/utils/hmac.ts).

#### Headers

This below signature is using the **HMAC Secret Key** of _"secret"_, so you will be able to test and compare generated signatures with the example payload.

```json
{
  "x-signature": "Qtt+sLAN4WvCMbup4feMayUepwTp0vma0Y3men4Anoo="
}
```

#### Payload

The payload is constructed of five items:

- context: A duplication of your partner identifier.
- reference: A reference to your customer that is purchasing through the marketplace, will be null if no ref is provided.
- retirement-tx: This identifier is a state proof ready string that links back to a Hedera transaction.
- total-credits-retired : The amount of credits that have been retired from the transaction.
- total-reserve-remaining: This provides a figure for the remaining credits that have been reserved for you after this retirement.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "context": "partner-identifier",
    "reference": "customer-ref",
    "retirement-tx": "0.0.1156-1663839551-50378818",
    "total-credits-retired": 10,
    "total-reserve-remaining": 2000
  }
}
```

### Stateproof Generation

DOVU uses state proofs to indicate when a particular purchase of credits has been retired as a fixed point in time, this is simply a transfer. We then generate the certificates which customers can view from their DOVU dashboard.

Upon receiving and validating the webhook you can generate a state proof through the above **retirement-tx** using this endpoint below, on testnet. These state proofs can be large, So the onus is on the integrator to have a GET request to the [Hedera Mirror Node](https://docs.hedera.com/guides/mirrornet/hedera-mirror-node) stateproof endpoint.

```
https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/transactions/0.0.1156-1663839551-50378818/stateproof
```

### Understanding the context of retirement-tx

We make the assumption that businesses want to select multiple projects for there clients to diversify the offering of credits, because of this there would naturally be many _retirement-tx_ values that represent the transfer events of different credit tokens.

So, to solve this DOVU has a dedicated topic to log a group of retirement events, for a single order. When a message is pushed onto the topic, the _transaction-id_ can be used to generate the required stateproof of the _collection of retirements_.

Each message will have a reference to many retirement transactions in this illustrated format, inside the topic

```json
{
  "retirement-txs": [
    "0.0.1156-1663839551-50378818",
    "0.0.1156-1663839551-50378819",
    "0.0.1156-1663839551-50378820"
  ]
}
```

This solution provides the flexibility of a pointer to many events while if you login to your business account you can look at the generated certificate for each individual credit retirement event.

## Final Words

Currently, our B2B integration features are in constant development. We will happily consider adding additional features and APIs to support your business requirements, just give us a shout!
